This calculator project is a web-based application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, percentage and division. The calculator is build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and no external libraries or frameworks are used to develop it.

Moreover, Object-oriented programming principles are used to structure the codebase, allowing for better code organization and easier maintenance. The project uses version control system, GIT, to manage the source code and track changes made to the project over time. This helps to ensure that the codebase remains stable and that changes can be easily tracked and reverted if necessary.

The calculator is currently in production mode, which means that it has been thoroughly tested and is ready for deployment to a production environment. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a clean and simple interface that allows users to perform calculations quickly and efficiently!
